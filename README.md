# Credit-card-fraud-detection
# Our project aimed to implement and compare two algorithms, SVM and Random Forest, for credit card fraud detection. 

# The project aims to classify the fraudulent transactions of credit cards, with high accuracy. The Credit Card Fraud Detection problem includes modeling credit card   transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turn out to be fraud. Such modeling will enable companies to efficiently flag a transaction which may be fraudulent.
