# Credit-card-fraud-detection

Our project aimed to implement and compare two algorithms, SVM and Random Forest, for credit card fraud detection. 

The project aims to classify the fraudulent transactions of credit cards, with high accuracy. The Credit Card Fraud Detection problem includes modeling credit card   transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turn out to be fraud. Such modeling will enable companies to efficiently flag a transaction which may be fraudulent.

In this project we analyze a dataset of credit card transactions made over a two-day period in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 (0.17%) are fraudulent.

** Conclusion **
We have implemented two algorithms Random Forest and SVM to construct models which predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. Comparing the two algorithms we reach a conclusion that the Random Forest algorithm provides accurate results compared to SVM.
